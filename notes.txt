i might want to have a drawer in my profile page just because it looks cool idk

form context might lead to performance issues 
triggering a re render 
use react memo hook to try to mitigate that 

v7 hooks-form 
    'react/jsx-props-no-spreading':'off',


okay so the plan is to 
- create barebones forms (add update and delete)
- add the working buttons to the garagepage. 
- make sure the styling works for all forms 

- add redux and implement other data stuff
