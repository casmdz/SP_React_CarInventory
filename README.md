# Homework 


#### Mod 7.1 - Start 

3 Components (anything related to the car inventory)
1 of those should accept a Prop 
Routing Functionality 
Styled with basic CSS and/or Material-UI 



#### Mod 7.2 - Dashboard 

Create a dashboard for your car inventory to live in. 

You will need to create the following:
- A Dashboard component (if you don't already have one)
- Styling for the Dashboard component
- Display a data table inside of the Dashboard using a separate component.




#### Mod 7.3 - Create/Update and Delete

Your task will be to create functionality for creating, updating and delete cars.

You will need to include the following:
- A way to delete
- Form(s) for Create/Update routes using react-form-hook

By the end, you should have the ability to create, update and delete cars from your collection using your front-end pages rather than using Insomnia.

Please submit your hosted Netlify URL as well so that I can see you have successfully deployed your application, and make sure that there is data in your database that will display on your React app.
